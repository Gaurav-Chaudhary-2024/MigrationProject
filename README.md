> A data-driven migration forecasting system that applies **Linear Algebra** and **Differential Equations** to predict future migration trends using historical and present-year data.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts **future migration data** by mathematically modeling population movement trends.  
Instead of relying on black-box ML models, the system uses **explicit mathematical formulations**, making predictions interpretable, verifiable, and academically robust.

The application evolved through multiple prototypes, progressively improving prediction accuracy, flexibility, and usability.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast migration data for future years using historical datasets  
- Apply **Linear Algebra** and **Differential Equations** to real-world data  
- Support both single-year and multi-year prediction modes  
- Provide **numerical + graphical** outputs for better analysis  
- Build a clean, academic, and recruiter-friendly project  

---

## 🧠 Mathematical Foundation

The prediction engine is built using:

### 🔹 Linear Algebra
- Matrix representations for multi-year data
- Transformations to handle varying time spans
- Structured computation for scalable predictions

### 🔹 Differential Equations
- Modeling change over time
- Trend-based extrapolation of migration patterns

These methods enable the system to move beyond simple interpolation and generate meaningful future forecasts.
